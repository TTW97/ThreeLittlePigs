There were 3 little pigs. They all wanted seperate houses so they went in the forest to build some. The first pig built his house out of straw. 
The second pig built his out of wood, and the third pig built his out of bricks. 
Then a friendly wolf came near and wanted to help the pigs build their houses, but secertly the third little pig wanted his house to be the best so he while he was building he was planning on how to destory the other houses.
